This is an illustrator application with small network capabilities. Pressing and holding the left mouse button paints
shapes to the canvas depending on which brush is selected. Pressing and holding right click will erase the canvas in the
shape of whatever is selected. Adjusting the slider scales the size of the brush. To save the canvas, press the "Save Image"
button. The drawing will be saved as "masterpiece.png" in the directory of the application.
