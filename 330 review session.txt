5a. a derived class inherits public/protected members of its base class

b. in c++ the class is the language construct used to create objects
	-structs used in c, inherently public data members

c. default access spec is private in classes

d.  polymorphic (behavior) is when member functions in a class hierarchy behave differently dpendong upon which obj performs call

e. an abstract/pure virtual class cannot be instantiated

f. a pure virtual function has no body or def in the class in which its declared

g. false, protected stays protected

h. false reference or value



extra credit: write implementation so that it was compile with gcc but not g++ and explain why
	- could overwrite the "new" keyword or "delete"

c: malloc, free, struct, char *, printf, void*, array[]
c++: new, delete, class, string, cout <<, dynamic cast, static cast, vector
